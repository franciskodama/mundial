### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! ðŸ‘‹

## WELCOME TO MY MUNDIAL WEBSITE PROJECT. ðŸ‘»

<hr />

# this.Project ðŸ“–

My first client website, my first big challenge.

## Why?

This client needed a new communication and a new website as well. I didn't have the opportunity to study deeply yet HTML and CSS, so as a starting point, I used the structure of a template website.
</br>
</br>

## How?

Even though I wasn't ready to build this website from scratch, I had to come up with a new brand, font type, icons, and customization for all areas.
</br>
</br>

## What?

The client was very pleased with the final outcome, and so was I. Seeing that I was on the right track was the best motivation for me to keep studying even harder.
